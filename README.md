# reLearn - <i>A Social Network For Learning</i>

## What are we solving?
<hr>
As the schools and colleges are closed, it is almost impossible for students to network with their peers and friends and stay motivated to learn a new skill at the same time. In this fast-moving and competitive world, it is very important for everyone to explore each and every skill possible and either have a basic knowledge about everything or be proficient at something. Here at reLearn, we redefine the learning process for each student allowing them to connect on a skill level and not on the basis of grades at subjects or the class they are studying in.

reLearn can be used by anyone who wants a partner or a peer to stay motivated to learn a new skill and work on collaborative projects. It is generally seen that people lose their interest while they are trying to self learn a new skill as they cannot be focused and be motivated to learn it. This is the reason why we decided to gamify our hack and add XP points, challenges, and fun rewards including discount coupons as well as vouchers. 

The reason for including a collaborative section was to encourage students to start collaborating from a very basic stage so that they knowingly or unknowingly learn to be a team performer, which is a huge asset in the present times.

## How?
<hr>
The features of our website include in-app chat and video streaming, and video calling services. skill and achievement showcase, project section - more coming soon. We will keep a track of a student's progress by getting submitting a course certificate and a project supporting it which will be further verified by our team and given XP points accordingly.
